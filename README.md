## React App for cp-notes

This repository contains the frontend React app for [cp-notes](https://cp-notes.com)! The frontend consumes a REST Api which is exposed by the backend, which can be found [here](https://github.com/askdfjlas/cp-notes-lambda).

## What's up with the repository name?

The app gets built into the `docs/` folder, which is hosted using Github pages (and can be visited at the name of the repository). If you visit the website using that url, or if you run it locally, then it will use the beta Api endpoints. This is a nice and cheap way for me to have a beta site with CI, and also not have to pay for website hosting :^)

## Contributing

Probably won't accept any contributions, feel free to open up issues though!
